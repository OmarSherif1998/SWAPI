# Star Wars React App

## Overview

- **Star Wars Movies**: Browse movie details and view additional information on demand.
- **Star Wars Planets**: Explore planet details with pagination and flip card interactions.
- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages using `i18next`.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large sets of data with pagination controls.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation.
